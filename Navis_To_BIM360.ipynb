    "#### Assigning Clashes:\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to interface with an expedited BIM360 workflow, we need to create special naming conventions, comments, and assignments that will be easily transferred to the BIM360 platform. We need to adjust the following:\n",
    "##### 1. Clash Name\n",
    "The clash name should correspond to Locations we will add to our BIM360 project. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Location Name.gif\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, all of the clashes are located in \"LL, North Wing, Foundation\".\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Status\n",
    "The status in Navisworks offers 5 options to choose from - New, Active, Reviewed, Approved, and Resolved. BIM360 on the other hand offers 4 status options - Open, In Review, Pending, and Closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Status.gif\">\n",
    "\n",
    "We generally try to adhere to the following rules:\n",
    "- __\"New\"__ status is the default, and therefor should not be used during export.\n",
    "- __\"Active\"__ status should be used for all active, non-penetration coordination related clashes. The \"Active\" status in Navisworks will correspond to the \"Open\" status in BIM360.\n",
    "- __\"Reviewed\"__ status in Navisworks corresponds to the \"In Review\" status in BIM360.\n",
    "- __\"Approved\"__ status works well in classifying \"Penetrations for Approval\". \"Approved\" in Navisworks corresponds to \"Pending\" in BIM360.\n",
    "- __\"Resolved\"__ status in Navisworks corresponds to the \"Closed\" status in BIM360.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Assigned To\n",
    "We can use assignments to preemptively assign clashes to members, roles, or companies.  Each of the parties assigned in Navisworks will need to be added to the BIM360 workspace exactly as they appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Assignments.gif\">\n",
    "\n",
    "__Members__ - Use an email address<br>\n",
    "__Role__ - Use one of the following BIM360 built-in roles:\n",

    "- Project Engineer\n",
    "- Project Manager\n",
    "- Superintendent\n",
    "- VDC Manager\n",
    "\n",
    "__Company__ - if assignment doesn't contain an email address or one of the pre-assigned roles, the script will default to Company.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4. Comments\n",
    "Comments can be used to accomplish 3 things: Priority Level, Location Descriptions, and Clash Detail Descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Comments and Assignments.PNG\">\n",
    "\n",
    "__Priority Level__ - Type either \"high\", \"medium\", or \"low\" to distinguish between priority.<br>\n",
    "__Location Descriptions__ - Add \"<\" to the beginning of the location description and \">\" to the end.<br>\n",
    "__Clash Detail Descriptions - Add \"*\" to the beginning and end of the clash detail description.\n",
